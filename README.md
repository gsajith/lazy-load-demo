## Optimize-load Demo

Comparison of normal-loading image vs. image with a blurhash canvas placeholder.
Built with NextJS.

## Run demo:

- Type in a link you want to optimize-load and hit "Store"
- Once storing process finishes, hard-reload your page to see images load. (turn on Network throttling in Dev Tools to see the effect more clearly)

## Dev instructions:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
